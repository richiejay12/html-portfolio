<hr />

<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>The thrill and background music is so amazing.</p>

<h3>Mosul</h3>
<p></p>The true story about how people in arab countries fight against ISIS is incredible.

<h3>Hachicko</h3>
<p>This dog story never missed to pour out my tears, as it so heart breaking to watch.</p>

<h3>Cardo</h3>
<p>Recommending it to watch for you waste 10 years of your life.
